# `tcpdump` Command in Linux

## ðŸ”¹ What is `tcpdump`?
- `tcpdump` is a packet analyzer (sniffer).
- It captures network packets going in/out of your systemâ€™s network interface.
- Very useful for debugging, troubleshooting, and analyzing network issues.

---
### ðŸ”¹ Basic Syntax
```
tcpdump [options] [expression]
```
- options = flags that modify how `tcpdump` runs.
- expression = filter (like `port 80`, `host 8.8.8.8`, etc.).


### Examples of Usage
#### Capture packets on default interface
```
sudo tcpdump
```
Shows live packets (raw format).
#### Capture packets on a specific interface
```
sudo tcpdump -i eth0
```
`-i` = choose interface (eth0, wlan0, etc.).

#### Show only first N packets
```
sudo tcpdump -c 10
```
`-c` = capture 10 packets only.

#### Capture packets from a specific host
```
sudo tcpdump host 8.8.8.8
```
Captures traffic only to/from Google DNS.

#### Capture packets on a specific port
```
sudo tcpdump port 80
```
Captures HTTP traffic.
#### Capture TCP or UDP traffic
```
sudo tcpdump tcp
sudo tcpdump udp
```
#### Save captured packets to a file
```
sudo tcpdump -w capture.pcap
```
`-w` = write to file.
Later analyze with Wireshark.
#### Read from a saved file
```
sudo tcpdump -r capture.pcap
```
#### Show packet contents in ASCII
```
sudo tcpdump -A
```
Useful for seeing raw HTTP requests.
#### More detailed packet info
```
sudo tcpdump -vvv
```
The more vâ€™s, the more verbose.
### Real-Life Use Cases
- Debugging why a service (e.g., web server) isnâ€™t reachable.
- Checking DNS request/response flow.
- Monitoring suspicious activity (security investigations).
- Saving traffic and analyzing later with Wireshark.

# TCP Flags in tcpdump Output
| Flag Symbol | Full Form                             | Meaning / When It Appears                                                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **S**       | SYN (Synchronize)                     | Used to initiate a TCP connection (1st step of 3-way handshake).                            |
| **.** (dot) | ACK (Acknowledgment)                  | Confirms receipt of data or a SYN. Almost all packets after connection setup carry ACK.     |
| **F**       | FIN (Finish)                          | Graceful connection termination request.                                                    |
| **R**       | RST (Reset)                           | Forcefully resets a TCP connection (e.g., if port closed or process not listening).         |
| **P**       | PSH (Push)                            | Tells the receiver to push buffered data to the application immediately (low latency data). |
| **U**       | URG (Urgent)                          | Indicates urgent data in the packet (rarely used).                                          |
| **E**       | ECE (ECN-Echo)                        | Explicit Congestion Notification echo (used for congestion control, RFC 3168).              |
| **C**       | CWR (Congestion Window Reduced)       | Sent when sender reduces its congestion window (with ECN).                                  |
| **W**       | CWR (sometimes shown as W in tcpdump) | Same as above, rarely seen.                                                                 |
| **N**       | Nonce                                 | Used in ECN nonce (experimental, rare).                                                     |

## Common Combinations Youâ€™ll See
- [S] â†’ SYN only â†’ "Please start a connection"
- [S.] â†’ SYN + ACK â†’ "I acknowledge your SYN, hereâ€™s mine"
- [.] â†’ ACK only â†’ "I got your data"
- [P.] â†’ PSH + ACK â†’ "Hereâ€™s data, deliver to app immediately"
- [F.] â†’ FIN + ACK â†’ "I want to close connection"
- [R] or [R.] â†’ RST (with/without ACK) â†’ "Reset/abort the connection"

### Example tcpdump Output With Flags
```makefile
10:00:01 IP 192.168.1.5.12345 > 192.168.1.10.80: Flags [S], seq 123456, win 65535, length 0
10:00:01 IP 192.168.1.10.80 > 192.168.1.5.12345: Flags [S.], seq 987654, ack 123457, win 65535, length 0
10:00:01 IP 192.168.1.5.12345 > 192.168.1.10.80: Flags [.], ack 987655, win 65535, length 0
```
This is the 3-way handshake:
- SYN
- SYN+ACK
- ACK
